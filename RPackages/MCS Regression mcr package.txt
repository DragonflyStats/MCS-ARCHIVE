Method Comparison Regression

This package provides regression methods to quantify the relation between two measurement methods. In particular it addresses regression problems with errors in both variables and without repeated measurements. The package provides implementations of Deming regression, weighted Deming regression, and Passing-Bablok regression following the CLSI EP09-A3 recommendations for analytical method comparison and bias estimation using patient samples.

Bendix Carstensen et al. proposed the use of LME models to allow for a more statistically rigourous approach to computing Limits of Agreement.  
The respective papers also discuss several shortcoming for techniques for dealing with replicate measurements, as proposed by Bland-Altman 1999.
