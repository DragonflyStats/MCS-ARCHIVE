# Intervals

It must be established clearly the specific purpose of the limits of agreement. According to **Bland and Altman (1995)**, the limits of agreement describe *how far apart measurements by the two methods were likely to be for most individuals.* This definition is echoed in their 1999 paper:

> *We can then say that nearly all pairs of measurements by the two methods will be closer together than these extreme values, which we call 95% limits of agreement. These values define the range within which most differences between measurements by the two methods will lie.* (Bland and Altman, 1999)

**Bland and Altman (1999)** note the similarity of limits of agreement to confidence intervals but emphasize that they are not the same. Interestingly, they describe the limits as *"being like a reference interval."*

Limits of agreement have a very similar construction to Shewhart control limits. The Shewhart chart is a well-known graphical methodology used in statistical process control. Consequently, there is potential for misinterpreting the limits of agreement as equivalent to Shewhart control limits. Importantly, the parameters used to determine the limits (mean and standard deviation) are not based on any sample used for analysis but on the process's historical values. This is a key difference compared to Bland-Altman limits of agreement.

**BXC (2008)** offers an alternative, more specific definition of the limits of agreement: *"a prediction interval for the difference between future measurements with the two methods on a new individual."* Although **BXC (2008)** regards the limits of agreement as a prediction interval, they state that it does not fit the formal definition of a prediction interval, as it does not consider the errors in parameter estimation.

Prediction intervals, often used in regression analysis, estimate an interval within which future observations will fall with a certain probability, based on observed data. **BXC (2008)** provides an alternative formulation, a 95% prediction interval for the difference:

$$\bar{d} \pm t_{(0.025, n-1)}S_{d} \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{n}}$$

where `n` is the number of subjects. Carstensen considers the effect of sample size on the interval width, noting that only for 61 or more subjects is the quantile less than 2.

**Luiz (2008)** describes limits of agreement as tolerance limits. A tolerance interval for a measured quantity is the interval in which a specified fraction of the population's values lie, with a specified level of confidence. Importantly, tolerance intervals share the same construction as Shewhart control limits.

## Formal Definition of Limits of Agreement

**Luiz (2008)** offers an alternative description of limits of agreement, describing them as tolerance limits. A tolerance interval for a measured quantity is the interval in which a specified fraction of the population's values lie, with a specified level of confidence. Similarly, **Barnhart** describes them as a probability interval and provides practical guidance: *if the absolute limit is less than an acceptable difference \(d_0\), then the agreement between the two methods is deemed satisfactory.*

The prevalence of contradictory definitions of limits of agreement affects the standard of reporting, as noted by **Mantha**.

## What Are Tolerance Intervals?

A tolerance interval is a statistical interval within which, with a certain confidence level, a specified proportion of a population's values fall. The *Engineering Statistics Handbook* explains the difference:

- Confidence limits describe where a population parameter (e.g., the mean) is expected to lie.
- Tolerance intervals describe the range of values that include a specific proportion of the population.

As discussed by **Vardeman (1992)**, tolerance intervals are less widely used compared to confidence intervals or prediction intervals, partly due to the educational emphasis on the latter. **Vardeman (1992)** argues that this lack of awareness can lead to the misuse of confidence intervals where tolerance intervals would be more appropriate. Curiously, **Carstensen et al. (2008)** describe limits of agreement as prediction intervals, despite noting that they are incorrectly formulated for this purpose.

## Why Are Tolerance Intervals Appropriate?

From their definition, tolerance intervals clearly function as Bland-Altman intended. They align with methodologies like the Total Deviation Index and Coverage Probability.
