## Agreement: Statistical Tools for Measuring Agreement

The **Agreement** package computes several statistics for measuring agreement, including:
- **Mean Square Deviation (MSD)**
- **Total Deviation Index (TDI)**
- **Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC)**

This package can be applied to both:
- Continuous data
- Categorical data (for multiple raters and multiple readings).

### Purpose

The primary goal of studying agreement is to answer the question:  
*Do the readings from one instrument or method agree with those from another instrument or method?*

### Key Features:
- **General Method**: Provides a framework to assess agreement for continuous and categorical data with repeated measurements using linear and generalized linear mixed models.
- **Likelihood-Based Approaches**: Estimates within- and between-instrument agreement statistics, with discussions on the asymptotic properties of these estimates across various data structures.
- **Handling Complexity**: Supports missing values and incorporates covariates naturally, making the method adaptable and robust.
- **Restricted Agreement Statistics**: Introduces a new set of statistics to isolate true random variations and between-instrument effects, minimizing the influence of covariates.
- **Simulations and Case Studies**: Demonstrates accuracy and effectiveness using examples related to method comparison and bioequivalence.

## Example Application: DCLHb Study

**DCLHb** is a treatment solution containing oxygen-carrying hemoglobin.  
In this study:
- DCLHb levels are routinely measured using the Sigma method.
- The simpler HemoCue method was modified to reproduce the DCLHb values of the Sigma method.
- Each sample's DCLHb values were measured by **both methods twice**.

The dataset contains 299 observations on 4 variables:
- **2 variables for the Sigma method**
- **2 variables for the HemoCue method**

## Sample R Code for the Agreement Package

Below is an example of how to analyze agreement using this package:

### Calculating Averages and Agreement Statistics
```R
# Load the data
data(DCLHb)

# Compute averages
HemocueAve <- apply(DCLHb[, c("HEMOCUE1", "HEMOCUE2")], 1, mean)
SigmaAve <- apply(DCLHb[, c("SIGMA1", "SIGMA2")], 1, mean)

# Calculate agreement statistics
agr <- agreement(
  y = HemocueAve, x = SigmaAve, 
  V_label = "Hemacue", H_label = "Sigma", 
  min = 0, max = 2000, by = 250, 
  CCC_a = 0.9775, CP_a = 0.9, TDI_a = 150, 
  error = "const", target = "random", 
  dec = 3, alpha = 0.05
)

summary(agr)
```

## Unified Agreement Statistics

The **unified.agreement** function can be used for more comprehensive agreement analysis.

### Code Example
```R
# Unified Agreement Analysis
ua <- unified.agreement(
  dataset = DCLHb, 
  var = c("HEMOCUE1", "HEMOCUE2", "SIGMA1", "SIGMA2"), 
  k = 2, m = 2, 
  CCC_a_intra = 0.9943, CCC_a_inter = 0.9775, CCC_a_total = 0.9775, 
  CP_a = 0.9, tran = 1, 
  TDI_a_intra = 75, TDI_a_inter = 150, TDI_a_total = 150, 
  error = "const", dec = 1, alpha = 0.05
)
