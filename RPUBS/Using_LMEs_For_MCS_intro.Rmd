# Fitting LME Models

## Overview of LME Models

Two **LME models** are fitted to the data:
1. **blood.nlme**: Fitted using the `nlme` package.
2. **blood.lme4**: Fitted using the `lme4` package.

In both cases:
- The method is characterized by a fixed effect.
- There is a random effect for each subject to account for replicate measurements associated with each subject.

The differences between the estimates provided by the respective models are negligible due to the simplicity of the model specifications.

## Appraisal of R Implementations

An appraisal of the current state of development for statistical software focuses on fitting LME models, particularly the R packages `nlme` and `lme4`.

### The **lme4** Package

- The `lme4` package is used to fit linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models in R.
- It is under active development, led by **Ben Bolker** (McMaster University, Canada).
- Almost all recent progress in LME modeling has been made for `lme4`-fitted models, particularly with the **Influence.ME** package (Nieuwenhuis et al., 2014).
- By contrast, there is minimal progress regarding `nlme` models, leading to exploration of the development workflows for both packages.

### The **nlme** Package

- The `nlme` package is now maintained by the R core development team.
- A key reference text: *Linear Mixed Effects Models Using R* by **Galecki & Burzykowski**.
- The accompanying package `nlmeU` is under current development, with version `0.70-3`.

### Douglas Bates' Contribution

- Douglas Bates, a prominent R developer in the LME domain, has shifted focus to developing LME models in Julia. This move has impacted active contributions to `nlme` and `lme4`.

## Fitting Models with the `nlme` R Package

The `nlme` package allows for specific features like direct specification of variance-covariance (VC) matrices for within-subject and between-subject residuals. This feature is particularly suitable for implementing **Roy's Model**.

## Fitting Models with the `lme4` R Package

The `lme4` package provides maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates for linear mixed-effects models using the `lmer` function. 

### Key Points:
- The model is described by a formula, including both fixed- and random-effects terms.
- The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model.
- The profiled deviance or REML criterion is optimized using constrained optimization functions in R.

The package structure supports advanced usage like fitting specialized linear mixed models (e.g., those incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines) that are not easily defined in `lmer`'s formula language.

## Example of LME Modeling with `lme4`

### Variables:
- **`y`**: Response variable
- **`method`**: Method of measurement
- **`subject`**: Subject
- **`MCSdata`**: Dataset

### Code Example:
```R
library(lme4)

MCS.lme4 <- lmer(y ~ method - 1 + (1 | subject), data = MCSdata)
```

## Important Considerations for MCS

A key issue is that the `nlme` package supports the specification of **Roy's Model**, including direct variance-covariance matrix specifications for within- and between-subject residuals. 

By contrast:
- The `lme4` package does not support Roy's Model due to its limitations.
- Advancing ideas from Roy's paper requires the `nlme` package.
- However, leveraging infrastructure provided for `lme4` models may necessitate a change in research questions away from Roy's paper.

Exploration of the capabilities of the **Influence.ME** package in the context of `lme4` models is warranted to complement this approach.
