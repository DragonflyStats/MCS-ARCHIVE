# Fitting LME Models for Method Comparison Studies

## Overview of LME Models

In this analysis, two **Linear Mixed-Effects (LME) models** are fitted to the data:

1. **blood.nlme**: A model fitted using the `nlme` package.
2. **blood.lme4**: A model fitted using the `lme4` package.

### Key Features of Both Models:
- The **method** is modeled as a fixed effect.
- A **random effect** is introduced for each subject to account for replicate measurements.

The differences in estimates between these models are negligible, primarily due to the simplicity of the model specifications.

## Appraisal of R Implementations

This section examines the current development landscape for statistical software designed to fit LME models, focusing on the two leading R packages: `nlme` and `lme4`.

### The **lme4** Package

- The `lme4` package is widely used for fitting linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models in R.
- It is under active development, with leadership by **Ben Bolker** (McMaster University, Canada).
- Significant advancements have been made for `lme4`-fitted models, particularly through extensions like the **Influence.ME** package (Nieuwenhuis et al., 2014).
- In contrast, fewer developments have been made for the `nlme` package, prompting an exploration of the development workflows for both.

### The **nlme** Package

- `nlme` is maintained by the **R core development team** and remains a cornerstone package for LME modeling.
- A key reference is the text *Linear Mixed Effects Models Using R* by **Galecki & Burzykowski**.
- Complementary development efforts include the `nlmeU` package, with version `0.70-3` currently available.

### Douglas Bates' Contribution

- Douglas Bates, a renowned developer in the LME domain, has shifted his focus to Julia for developing LME models. This shift has impacted active contributions to both `nlme` and `lme4`.

## Fitting Models with the `nlme` R Package

The `nlme` package supports direct specification of **variance-covariance (VC) matrices**, particularly for within-subject and between-subject residuals. This capability makes it well-suited for implementing **Roy's Model** and other advanced techniques.

## Fitting Models with the `lme4` R Package

The `lme4` package enables the computation of maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates for LME models via the `lmer` function.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Model Formula**: Includes both fixed and random effects.
- **Optimization**: Uses constrained optimization functions in R to evaluate and optimize the profiled deviance or REML criterion.
- **Advanced Applications**: Supports specialized linear mixed models (e.g., models involving pedigrees or smoothing splines) that may not be expressible in the formula language used by `lmer`.

## Example of LME Modeling with `lme4`

### Variables:
- **`y`**: Response variable
- **`method`**: Method of measurement
- **`subject`**: Subject identifier
- **`MCSdata`**: The dataset used for modeling

### Code Example:
```R
library(lme4)

# Fitting an LME model
MCS.lme4 <- lmer(y ~ method - 1 + (1 | subject), data = MCSdata)
```

---

## Important Considerations for MCS

### The Challenge:
- The `nlme` package is equipped to support **Roy's Model**, allowing for direct variance-covariance matrix specifications.
- Conversely, the `lme4` package does not support this feature, limiting its capability for implementing Roy's methodology.

### The Way Forward:
- To advance ideas from Roy's research, it is necessary to use the `nlme` package.
- However, the robust infrastructure of `lme4` may necessitate re-framing research questions to align with its capabilities.
- Exploring tools like the **Influence.ME** package offers additional avenues for extending LME analyses with `lme4`.
