# Variations and Alternative to Bland-Altman Plot

## Bartko's Ellipse

As an enhancement to the Bland-Altman Plot, **Bartko** proposed a confidence ellipse for covariates. According to **Bartko**, the bivariate confidence ellipse acts as a boundary for dispersion, with the purpose of "amplifying dispersion"—presumably for outlier detection. The orientation of the ellipse is key to interpreting the results:

- The minor axis reflects between-item variability.
- The major axis is related to the mean squared error (referred to as Error Mean Square).

The ellipse visually illustrates the size of both relative to each other. Consequently, Bartko's ellipse helps:

1. Determine the relationship between variances.
2. Assess the variance of the means $Var(a_{i})$ against the variance of the differences $Var(d_{i})$.

- If $\text{Var}(a)$ > $\text{Var}(d)$, the ellipse orientation is horizontal.
- If $\text{Var}(a)$ < $\text{Var}(d)$, the ellipse orientation is vertical.

A more horizontal ellipse suggests greater agreement between the two methods being tested.

### Outlier Detection
Bartko emphasizes that the ellipse can also aid in detecting outliers. For example, in the Bland-Altman plot for Grubbs' data, complemented by Bartko's ellipse, the fourth observation falls outside the bounds of the ellipse, marking it as a potential outlier. However, outlier classification must align with the data's logic:

- Points with noticeable horizontal displacement (supported by two independent measurements) should not be immediately considered outliers.
- Points with noticeable vertical displacement, like the fourth observation, may indicate outliers.

## Survival-Agreement Plot

Proposed by **Luiz**, the Survival-Agreement Plot offers a unique approach to method comparison studies. It is entirely distinct from the Bland-Altman plot and utilizes the Kaplan-Meier method—a well-known technique in Survival Analysis. Luiz suggests complementing this method with common survival analysis techniques to provide new insights into agreement.

### Key Features
1. The Survival-Agreement Plot uses limits of tolerance to express agreement (or disagreement).
2. Kaplan-Meier steps occur at the absolute observed differences between two measurement methods.

**Axes Explanation:**
- **X-axis:** Absolute observed differences.
- **Y-axis:** Proportion of cases with at least the observed difference ($x_i$).

This approach also employs the log-rank test to detect inter-method bias and Cox regression to measure its magnitude.

## Mountain Plot

A graphical method introduced by **Krouwer and Monti** for evaluating laboratory assays, the Mountain Plot (or Folded Empirical Cumulative Distribution Plot) computes percentiles for ranked differences between two methods. By "folding" at the 50th percentile, a histogram-like function ("the mountain") is produced.

### Advantages
1. Detects large, infrequent errors (differences).
2. Easily identifies the central 95% of data, even when data are not Normally distributed.
3. Allows easy comparison of distributions.

Mountain plots serve as a useful complement to Bland-Altman plots.

### Plot Creation
1. Compute percentiles for ranked differences between two methods.
2. For percentiles above 50, apply the transformation: `Percentile = 100 - Percentile`.
3. Plot the resulting percentiles against the differences.
