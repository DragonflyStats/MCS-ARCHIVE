# Test 3

The last of the three variability tests compares the overall variabilities of both methods.

Overall variability between the two methods ($\Omega$) is the sum of between-subject ($D$) and within-subject variability ($\Sigma$):

$$
\text{Block } \boldsymbol{\Omega}_i = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
d^2_1 & d_{12} \\ 
d_{12} & d^2_2 
\end{bmatrix} 
+ 
\begin{bmatrix} 
\sigma^2_1 & \sigma_{12} \\ 
\sigma_{12} & \sigma^2_2 
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

### Variance-Covariance Matrices:
With the null model, the MLE of the within-subject variance-covariance matrix is determined as follows:

$$
\boldsymbol{\hat{\Omega}}_{CS} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
1007.92 & 801.65 \\ 
801.65 & 1007.92 
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
\boldsymbol{\hat{\Omega}}_{Symm} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
961.38 & 801.40 \\ 
801.40 & 1054.43 
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

The log-likelihood of the alternative model is $-2045.2$, while the null model has a log-likelihood of $-2030.7$. The test statistic is $28.884$, and the $p$-value is less than $0.0001$. Thus, the null hypothesis that both methods have equal overall variability is rejected. This difference is specifically attributed to the difference in within-subject variabilities, as demonstrated by the second variability test.

## Model Fit 3

This model is more general compared to "Model Fit 2". It treats the random interactions for each subject as a vector, allowing the variance-covariance matrix for that vector to be estimated from all positive-definite matrices.

### Model Specification:
$$
\boldsymbol{y_{i}} = \boldsymbol{X_{i}\beta} + \boldsymbol{Z_{i}b_{i}} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon_{i}}, \quad i = 1, \dots, 85
$$

Where:
- $\boldsymbol{Z_{i}} \sim \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{0,\Psi})$
- $\boldsymbol{\epsilon_{i}} \sim \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{0,\sigma^2\Lambda})$

## Variability Test 3

This test determines whether both methods $A$ and $B$ have the same overall variability.

### Hypotheses:
$$
H_{0}: \sigma_{A} = \sigma_{B} \quad \text{(equal variability)} \\
H_{A}: \sigma_{A} \neq \sigma_{B} \quad \text{(different variability)}
$$

The null model assumes a symmetric form for both $\boldsymbol{\hat{D}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\hat{\Lambda}}$, while the alternative model uses a compound symmetry form.

### Bland-Altman's Blood Data:

- **Null Model Variance-Covariance Matrix:**

$$
\boldsymbol{\hat{\Sigma}_{Symm}} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
961.38 & 801.40 \\ 
801.40 & 1054.43 
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

- **Alternative Model Variance-Covariance Matrix:**

$$
\boldsymbol{\hat{\Sigma}_{CS}} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
1007.92 & 801.65 \\ 
801.65 & 1007.92 
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

The test statistic is calculated as the difference between the $-2$ log-likelihoods: $28.884$, with a $p$-value less than $0.0001$. The null hypothesis is rejected, indicating different overall variability for the two modelsâ€”a conclusion supported by the second variability test.

## Nested Model (Overall Variability)

This third nested model tests overall variability, essentially serving as a joint test for between-item and within-item variability. While the motivation for including this test is unclear, it provides a simplified procedure that avoids multiple comparison procedures in certain scenarios, which can benefit non-statisticians.

### Example Code:
```R
> NMO.fit = lme(y ~ meth-1, data = dat,   # CS , CS #
+     random = list(item=pdCompSymm(~ meth-1)), 
+     correlation = corCompSymm(form = ~1 | item/repl), 
+     method = "ML")
```
